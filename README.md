# DATA030 Project - Fall2022
In the car market, the price of a new car is typically set by the manufacturer, but the value of a used car is harder to determine. This is because a used car's value can be affected by factors such as its age, mileage, and condition. In my project, I aim to predict the prices of used cars using supervised machine learning models. By selecting the best model based on its performance on a test set, I hope to provide a useful tool for people to find the reasonable price of a used car. Because the target variable, car price, is a continuous variable, this problem is defined as a regression problem. To build and evaluate the models, I will use a dataset of used car listings that includes relevant features and prices. I will use RMSE (root mean squared error) as evaluation metrics to compare the performance of different models and select the best one.
