# DATA030 Project - Fall2022
In the car market, the price of a new car is mainly provided by manufacturers. On the other hand, the value of a used car is hard to determine due to a variety of factors. In my project, I am going to predict the price of used cars with the supervised machine learning models, and hope the best model will help people find a reasonable deal on a used car. 

For more details about what python version and package versions were used to develop the code, please see data1030.yml file.
